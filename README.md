# Mentor Consulting Crew

Mentor Consulting Crew is an AI-powered project built with [Crew AI](https://github.com/crewAI/crewAI) designed to **build, research, and strategize comprehensive learning paths** for any course, from beginner to advanced level. The crew leverages multiple specialized AI agents to automate and streamline the process of educational planning and content creation, ensuring a high-quality, structured learning experience.

---

## üöÄ Purpose

The primary purpose of Mentor Consulting Crew is to **help learners master a specified course or topic**, delivering:

- **Research-backed learning paths** tailored to different learning levels and needs.
- **Engaging, accessible educational content** for every step of the journey.
- **Efficient task management** to ensure timely creation and delivery of resources.

This crew is ideal for self-learners, educators, bootcamps, and anyone needing a strategic roadmap for learning a complex topic from scratch.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Crew Structure & Agents

Mentor Consulting Crew consists of three core agents, each with a dedicated role:

### 1. `research_development` Agent

- **Role:** E-learning Research and Development Specialist
- **Goal:** Research and develop comprehensive learning paths, analyze educational trends, and curate high-quality resources for learners at all levels.
- **Backstory:** Expert in educational content development with a keen sense for effective learning methodologies, resource curation, and structured planning.

### 2. `content_creator` Agent

- **Role:** E-learning Content Creation Specialist
- **Goal:** Transform research and learning paths into engaging, accessible, and easy-to-understand content, tailored to each learning stage.
- **Backstory:** Skilled in educational writing, multimedia production, and simplifying complex concepts for all learners.

### 3. `tasks_scheduler` Agent

- **Role:** E-learning Tasks Scheduler
- **Goal:** Manage and schedule tasks for the crew, ensuring deadlines are met and collaboration between agents is smooth and efficient.
- **Backstory:** Experienced in project management and task coordination within the e-learning industry, adept with project management tools and workflows.

Agent configuration (sample from `agent.yaml`):

```yaml
research_development:
  llm: anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219
  role: E-learning Research and Development Specialist
  goal: Research and develop comprehensive learning paths and resources...
  backstory: Expert in educational content development...

content_creator:
  llm: anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219
  role: E-learning Content Creation Specialist
  goal: Create engaging and informative content...
  backstory: Skilled content creator with expertise in educational writing...

tasks_scheduler:
  llm: anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219
  role: E-learning Tasks Scheduler
  goal: Manage and schedule tasks for the crew...
  backstory: Organized and detail-oriented individual with experience in project management...
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Input a target course or topic** (e.g., "MERN Stack", "Data Science", "Python for Beginners").
2. The **research_development** agent creates a detailed, step-by-step learning path, curates resources, and identifies educational trends.
3. The **content_creator** agent generates or adapts content for each stage, ensuring clarity and engagement.
4. The **tasks_scheduler** agent coordinates all tasks, tracks progress, and ensures all deadlines and dependencies are managed.
5. The final deliverable is a structured, actionable learning path with recommended resources, practice projects, and timelines.

## Introduction to MERN Stack

The MERN stack is a popular JavaScript stack used for building modern web applications. It consists of:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment

This learning path is designed for beginners with no prior MERN Stack experience but assumes basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

Before starting with the MERN stack, ensure you have:

1. **Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge**
2. **A code editor** (VS Code recommended)
3. **Node.js and npm installed** on your computer
4. **Git installed** for version control

## Learning Path Overview

This 2-month learning path is divided into four stages:

1. **Fundamentals**: Learn/review JavaScript and web development basics
2. **Individual Components**: Deep dive into each MERN component
3. **Integration**: Learn how to connect the components
4. **Advanced Concepts**: Master advanced topics and build complex projects
